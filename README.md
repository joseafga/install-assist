INSTALL ASSIST
======
Interactive tool to guide the user step by step in the Mazon OS installation.

*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [PortuguÃªs (BR)](README.pt-BR.md).*

Why?
------
Upon hearing about the difficulty of manually installing a system can cause afraid to users, as well the automation remove part of the learning, this gave me the idea of a new approach. Something that facilitates the installation but in a way that teaches the user. It was then that **Install Assist** arise, an interactive approach that teaches the user to install and configure the system and can validate possible errors.
